ðŸš™ CAR THEFT DATA ANALYSIS ðŸš™
National news suggest an increase in car theft for certain makes and models. Data analysis was performed on car theft data from data.world showing the vehicle make and models that get stolen more frequently using Word Cloud in Python.
Data imported into sample_data folder Source: https://data.world/jboutros/2015-car-thefts-by-state
Installed libraries.
Create list of vehicles
Created Frequency dictionary to count car makes such as Nissan, Toyota and the number of times it is stolen.
Created word cloud/tag cloud showing which car make and model are stolen more frequently than others in the form of word size. Bigger the word, higher is the frequency that word was repeated in the data.
